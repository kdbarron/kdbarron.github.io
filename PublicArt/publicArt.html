          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>I was the lead researcher for this project. I was in charge of reaching out to local artists in pittsburgh who created public art, as well as ensure the quality of our research in the field was above and beyond expectations</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12 wow fadeInLeft">
          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>Our project looked at how we could create an engaging way to attract people to public art in the Pittsburgh area. We conducted several research sessions and from our synthesis came up with the idea of Engagement Eggs. These eggs would be placed outside of public art displays and would contain information about the art piece. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12 wow fadeInLeft">
          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>It's unclear how public art affects livibility in the city of Pittsburgh. Most other cities have public art displays, so this is a generalizable problem. By trying to create this metric for engagement, we can better utilize popular areas of the city to solve problems related to economic disparity and city livability.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12 wow fadeInRight">
          <h2>Research Methods</h2>
          <p>Our team used three different generative research methods, including Observe & Intercept, Think-Aloud Protocol, and Semi-Structured Interviews. We also used evaluative methods, including Speeddating, and experience prototyping.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12 wow fadeInLeft">
          <h2>Evidence</h2>
          <p>Some evidence that we received while conducting our research included the following: <br>"If I saw the eggs at a different art piece I would want it to be like a scavenger hunt. These eggs are so cool I would want to hold on to them and have like a collection." - Member of the public</p>
			<p>“I don’t get questions often from people, but I love answering questions if people have them. I want to make the information available for everyone interested but I don’t think anyone reads the plaques because it’s boring.” - Pittsburgh Artist</p>
        </div>
		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12 wow fadeInLeft">
          <h2>Insights</h2>
          <p>Based on the synthesis of our research, we found three key insights related to public art and Pittsburgh residents: <br>1. Public art is good for Pittsburgh. People think public art is a beneficial part of the city; it has a positive impact on both them and the surrounding community.<br>2. Artists and the public can be connected. Artists are interested in hearing from public about artworks, and the public has many questions that artists could answer.<br>3. People crave quick, easy to find information. People are interested in learning fun and easily accessible information about the artworks, searching first at the artwork, but not online.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12 wow fadeInLeft">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Based on our Insights, we created a protoype of a scavenger hunt experience with gold eggs that contain paper with fun facts about the art piece as well as an image of the artwork. These eggs can be found at the art piece for anyone to take. It’ll encourage those that might not otherwise engage with the art to seek out more eggs at other art pieces and learn more about the art.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12 wow fadeInRight">
          <h2>Going Forward</h2>
          <p>We would like to continue measuring engagement with public art by creating a social media account which people could post their collection of eggs to. Ideally we would have multiple egg locations, so that people would have to engage in a scavenger hunt for all different kinds of eggs.</p>
